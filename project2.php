    <h1>Tower Defense Game XR/VR</h1>
    <p>Tower defense (TD) is a subgenre of strategy games where the goal is to defend a player's territories or
        possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers or by stopping enemies from reaching the exits, usually achieved
        by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack.[1] This typically means building a variety of
        different structures that serve to automatically block, impede, attack or destroy enemies. Tower defense is seen
        as a subgenre of real-time strategy video games, due to its real-time origins,[2][3] even though many modern
        tower defense games include aspects of turn-based strategy. Strategic choice and positioning of defensive
        elements is an essential strategy of the genre.
